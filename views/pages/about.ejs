        <p>Welcome to FoodFinder! This website will be about getting the most out of your ingredients. Have you ever looked in your fridge and been confused on what to make for dinner? Now you can simply generate a list of possible recipes with the ingredients you have available! Other services that may be added in the future include recipe steps included in the generation and resturant lookup based on food types or calorie/macro nutrients requirements. The core features of this website are mainly going to be about retrieving recipes that match a given set of requirements and returning a list of recipes that match that requirement.</p>
