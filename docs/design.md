Design
=========

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
--------------------------------
One of the main focuses of the service will be on the design of its UI and functionality
to be as focused as possible. The primary way I am going to focus on achieve that will be
to limit the amount of controls on the finder portion itself until they are needed by the
user. One example of this would be to add drop down menus for the more auxiliary controls
to ensure that the user only sees them if they see the context for the menu and determines
that it would help their experience. 


Help and Documentation
------------------------
The other main focus of the site will be about being as transparent as possible about the 
functionality of the site and its controls. They main way that I will try to ensure this will
be to add help pop-ups where necessary in order to conform to my other design principle of 
minimalist design while still having documentation ready to clarify features. Hovering
over a (*i*) symbol or drop-down menu will show additional context for that control/menu
but will hide it when unnecessary to avoid slowing down the user. 

A good example of the end result will be something like this:

Color Scheme & Typography
-------------
The color scheme/palette that I have decided to go with is a group of analogous colors with
a base color of Dark Orange (#FF8C00). The reason that I have chose this set of colors is mainly
to get a good amount of variety while keeping the theme cohesive and focused. I can take advantage
of the variety of contrasting colors to highlight important information and to make the site more 
visually appealing.

The font family I have chosen will be Helvetica Neue. I chose this typeface because it's simple yet 
timeless and elegant and will be easy to read on any device. Another benefit is that this typeface is widely 
used and will be familiar to most users. Some typography techniques I will try to stick to are quite
simple. I will try to use a consistent font size and weight throughout the site to make it more
readable and to make it easier to navigate. This will mean using a consistent size between headers, navigation,
and controls in order to make information, as well as its purpose, immediately recognizable.
